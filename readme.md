# libglob.rs

This is an incomplete, toy re-implementation of `grep`, which I used as an exercise to learn Rust.

## Documentation

Download and run
```commandline
cargo build
target/debug/grep --help
```

Or, run:
```commandline
man grep
```
(But be aware that this is by no means a complete re-implementation of GNU's `grep` or any other form of `grep`.)
